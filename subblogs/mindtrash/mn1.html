    i hate forgetting. forgetting is like losing something that youâ€™ve cherished over time. forgetting is extremely stark. forgetting means you no longer have that one memory of that one moment that occurred that gave you immense happiness, or that one moment that gave you immense pain. forgetting gives me the pits. forgetting is when you not just lose something, you lose a part of yourself â€” you lose a part of what made you <i>you</i>. forgetting keeps me up at night â€” the fact that if one day, god forbid, i am on my deathbed, and i canâ€™t recall a single occurrence in my life, be it positive, or be it negative, just a single memory, absolutely terrifies me. forgetting means i can no longer reconnect with the hundreds of people iâ€™ve interacted with in my life. forgetting means i will never recall the laughs we shared, the fights we fought, the long and passionate conversations we had, the glances made at each other, the petty silent treatment we gave each other, the lunches we ate together, the times we yelled at the top of our lungs supporting our favourite sports team, the moment we realised we were growing increasingly distant and there was nothing we could do about it, and the moment we finally drift apart, to never again collide paths to relive all that we had experienced together, as a whole, as birds of a feather. forgetting is an equal part curse, equal part boon. forgetting sometimes can be used to my own advantage â€” i can now choose to ignore bitter truths or unsavoury memories and repress those memories. forgetting isnâ€™t infallible however, and when those repressed memories are exposed, they hurt a thousand times the amount that you experienced originally. forgetting creates a void in your memory spacetime, and as you grow older, as your brain cells begin to slowly deteriorate and neurons begin to disintegrate, these voids start multiplying and eventually, you are in that same blank state that you were when you arrived into this world. forgetting has a more real, dark and concrete form as dementia, and i think if there is anything that i am truly scared of, it would be being afflicted with dementia â€” not cancer of any form, or any one of those dreadful diseases. forgetting, as a fear, might seem trivial and childish; maybe it is, maybe it isnâ€™t, but thatâ€™s for you to decide. forgetting must be the most deep and pervasive fear. forgetting, for me, is the greatest horror of mankind, and will haunt me forever. forgetting is my existential nightmare, and yet, i forget. i forget so much and so frequently that i feel the need to record and archive every single moment of my life and hoard those memories in some physical manner, in a place safe from the inherently forgetful mind.

        what can i do about it? nothing. absolutely nothing. and that is the sole reason why itâ€™s my most absolute, primal fear. i could store memories in a box of items, in a collage of photos, in a folder of letters, in an archive of chats â€” but all those are simply ephemeral in the grand scheme of things. the box of items will be thrown away to make space for when another box of items arrives, the collage of photos will slowly begin to fade and lose its colours and detail, the folder of letters may be accidentally shredded or again, simply fade and degenerate, the archive of chats may get deleted by drive failure â€” nothing is permanent, nothing is eternal, nothing is long-lasting, nothing, nothing that can make sure that i existed, and we were friends, and they went on a picnic together, and she sent me a greeting card, and he told me that one joke that i found so funny, i nearly threw up laughing.

    so, just maybe, can we smile at each other when we meet eyes?
